      It's cool now in the kitchen
      That happens when you're bitten
      I'm stirring and stirring
      Deliciously pouring
      And I know you're gonna love this
      A better kind of justice
      I don't want it burning
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
      Made you something that I know you'll like
      Chocolate-covered sugar and spice
      Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty
      Candy colors, oh so nice
      Take a bite of my poison cake, yum
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Take a bite of my poison cake
      Been cooking in my cauldron late
      You're never ever gonna stay awake
      You're going down, down, down
      You thought I was a servant slave
      But I am just a serpent snake
      You better genuflect and pray
      You better genuflect and pray
      Tingles of poison are hitting your veins
      What have you done?
      Your words are slurring as you fall down
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
      Made you something that I know you'll like
      Chocolate-covered sugar and spice
      Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty
      Candy colors, oh so nice
      Take a bite of my
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      It's not my fault, I got carried away
      I lost control when I started to bake
      A dash of death is bitter to swallow
      Don't be scared, you'll be buried tomorrow
      Poison
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
      Poison cake
